# TTA-DLProject
Deep Learning 2024 Project.

## Project Objective
Develop a TTA method that enhances the predictive capabilities of a network on test samples x âˆˆ X , without having access to the labels of the test samples or the remaining data in X . Before analyzing each new sample, the state
of the network must be reset to the initial configuration (i.e., reloading the pre-trained weights).
